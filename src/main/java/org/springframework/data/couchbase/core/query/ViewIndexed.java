/**
 * This annotation is targeted at {@link CouchbaseRepository Repository} interfaces, indicating that
 * the framework should ensure a View is present when the repository is instantiated.
 * <p/>
 * The view must at least be described as a design document name and view name. Default map function
 * will filter documents on the type associated to the repository, and default reduce function is "_count".
 * <p/>
 * One can specify a custom reduce function as well as a non-default map function. This can be done on methods,
 * allowing for multiple views per repository to be created.
